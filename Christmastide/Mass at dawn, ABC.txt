R. A light will shine on us this day: the Lord is born for us.
The LORD is king; let the earth rejoice; 
let the many islands be glad. 
The heavens proclaim his justice, 
and all peoples see his glory.
R. A light will shine on us this day: the Lord is born for us.
Light dawns for the just; 
and gladness, for the upright of heart. 
Be glad in the LORD, you just, 
and give thanks to his holy name.
R. A light will shine on us this day: the Lord is born for us.
