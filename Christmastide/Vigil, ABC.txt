R. Forever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
I have made a covenant with my chosen one, 
I have sworn to David my servant: 
Forever will I confirm your posterity 
and establish your throne for all generations.
R. Forever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
Blessed the people who know the joyful shout; 
in the light of your countenance, O LORD, they walk. 
At your name they rejoice all the day, 
and through your justice they are exalted.
R. Forever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
He shall say of me, "You are my father, 
my God, the rock, my savior." 
Forever I will maintain my kindness toward him, 
and my covenant with him stands firm.
R. Forever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
