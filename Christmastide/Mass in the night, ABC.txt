R. Today is born our Savior, Christ the Lord.
Sing to the Lord a new song; 
sing to the Lord, all you lands. 
Sing to the Lord; bless his name.
R. Today is born our Savior, Christ the Lord.
Announce his salvation, day after day. 
Tell his glory among the nations; 
among all peoples, his wondrous deeds.
R. Today is born our Savior, Christ the Lord.
Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice; 
let the sea and what fills it resound; 
let the plains be joyful and all that is in them! 
Then shall all the trees of the forest exult.
R. Today is born our Savior, Christ the Lord.
They shall exult before the Lord, for he comes; 
for he comes to rule the earth. 
He shall rule the world with justice 
and the peoples with his constancy.
R. Today is born our Savior, Christ the Lord.
