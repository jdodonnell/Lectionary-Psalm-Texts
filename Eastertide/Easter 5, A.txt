R. Lord, let your mercy be on us, as we place our trust in you. 
Exult, you just, in the LORD; 
praise from the upright is fitting. 
Give thanks to the LORD on the harp; 
with the ten-stringed lyre chant his praises.
R. Lord, let your mercy be on us, as we place our trust in you. 
Upright is the word of the LORD, 
and all his works are trustworthy. 
He loves justice and right; 
of the kindness of the LORD the earth is full. 
R. Lord, let your mercy be on us, as we place our trust in you. 
See, the eyes of the LORD are upon those who fear him, 
upon those who hope for his kindness, 
to deliver them from death 
and preserve them in spite of famine.
R. Lord, let your mercy be on us, as we place our trust in you.
