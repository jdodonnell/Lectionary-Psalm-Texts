R. I will praise you, Lord, in the assembly of your people.
I will fulfill my vows before those who fear the LORD. 
The lowly shall eat their fill; 
they who seek the LORD shall praise him: 
"May your hearts live forever!"
R. I will praise you, Lord, in the assembly of your people.
All the ends of the earth 
shall remember and turn to the LORD; 
all the families of the nations 
shall bow down before him.
R. I will praise you, Lord, in the assembly of your people.
To him alone shall bow down 
all who sleep in the earth; 
before him shall bend 
all who go down into the dust. 
R. I will praise you, Lord, in the assembly of your people.
And to him my soul shall live; 
my descendants shall serve him. 
Let the coming generation be told of the LORD 
that they may proclaim to a people yet to be born 
the justice he has shown. 
R. I will praise you, Lord, in the assembly of your people.
