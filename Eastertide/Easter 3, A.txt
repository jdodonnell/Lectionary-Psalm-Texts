R. Lord, you will show us the path of life. 
Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge; 
I say to the LORD, "My LORD are you." 
O LORD, my allotted portion and my cup, 
you it is who hold fast my lot.
R. Lord, you will show us the path of life. 
I bless the LORD who counsels me; 
even in the night my heart exhorts me. 
I set the LORD ever before me; 
with him at my right hand I shall not be disturbed. 
R. Lord, you will show us the path of life. 
Therefore my heart is glad and my soul rejoices, 
my body, too, abides in confidence; 
because you will not abandon my soul to the netherworld, 
nor will you suffer your faithful one to undergo corruption. 
R. Lord, you will show us the path of life. 
You will show me the path to life, 
abounding joy in your presence, 
the delights at your right hand forever.
R. Lord, you will show us the path of life.
