"His mercy endures forever."

"His mercy endures forever." 
Let those who fear the LORD say, 
"His mercy endures forever."

I was hard pressed and was falling, 
but the LORD helped me. 
My strength and my courage is the LORD, 
and he has been my savior. 
The joyful shout of victory 
in the tents of the just.

The stone which the builders rejected 
has become the cornerstone. 
By the LORD has this been done; 
it is wonderful in our eyes. 
This is the day the LORD has made; 
let us be glad and rejoice in it.
R. Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, 
his love is everlasting.
