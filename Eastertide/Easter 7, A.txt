R. I believe that I shall see the good things of the Lord 
in the land of the living.
The LORD is my light and my salvation; 
whom should I fear? 
The LORD is my life's refuge; 
of whom should I be afraid? 
R. I believe that I shall see the good things of the Lord 
in the land of the living.
One thing I ask of the LORD; this I seek; 
To dwell in the house of the LORD 
all the days of my life, 
That I may gaze on the loveliness of the LORD 
and contemplate his temple. 
R. I believe that I shall see the good things of the Lord 
in the land of the living.
Hear, O Lord, the sound of my call; 
have pity on me, and answer me. 
Of you my heart speaks; you my glance seeks.
R. I believe that I shall see the good things of the Lord 
in the land of the living.
