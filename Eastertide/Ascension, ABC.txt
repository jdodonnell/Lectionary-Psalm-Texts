R. God mounts his throne to shouts of joy: a blare 
of trumpets for the Lord.
All you peoples, clap your hands, 
shout to God with cries of gladness, 
For the LORD, the Most High, the awesome, 
is the great king over all the earth.
R. God mounts his throne to shouts of joy: a blare

God mounts his throne amid shouts of joy; 
the LORD, amid trumpet blasts. 
Sing praise to God, sing praise; 
sing praise to our king, sing praise.
R. God mounts his throne to shouts of joy: a blare 
of trumpets for the Lord.
For king of all the earth is God; 
sing hymns of praise. 
God reigns over the nations, 
God sits upon his holy throne.

of trumpets for the Lord.
