R. Lord, let your face shine on us.
When I call, answer me, O my just God, 
you who relieve me when I am in distress; 
have pity on me, and hear my prayer!
R. Lord, let your face shine on us.
Know that the LORD does wonders for his faithful one; 
the LORD will hear me when I call upon him.
R. Lord, let your face shine on us.
O LORD, let the light of your countenance shine upon us! 
You put gladness into my heart.
R. Lord, let your face shine on us.
As soon as I lie down, I fall peacefully asleep, 
for you alone, O LORD, 
bring security to my dwelling. 
R. Lord, let your face shine on us.
