R. I will praise your name forever, my king and my God.
The LORD is gracious and merciful, 
slow to anger and of great kindness. 
The LORD is good to all 
and compassionate toward all his works.
R. I will praise your name forever, my king and my God.
Let all your works give you thanks, O LORD, 
and let your faithful ones bless you. 
Let them discourse of the glory of your kingdom 
and speak of your might.
R. I will praise your name forever, my king and my God.
Let them make known your might to the children of Adam, 
and the glorious splendor of your kingdom. 
Your kingdom is a kingdom for all ages, 
and your dominion endures through all generations.
R. I will praise your name forever, my king and my God.
