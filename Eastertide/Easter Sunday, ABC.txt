R. This is the day the Lord has made; 
let us rejoice and be glad.
Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, 
for his mercy endures forever. 
Let the house of Israel say, 
"His mercy endures forever."
R. This is the day the Lord has made; 
let us rejoice and be glad.
"The right hand of the LORD has struck with power; 
the right hand of the LORD is exalted. 
I shall not die, but live, 
and declare the works of the LORD."
R. This is the day the Lord has made; 
let us rejoice and be glad.
The stone which the builders rejected 
has become the cornerstone. 
By the LORD has this been done; 
it is wonderful in our eyes.
R. This is the day the Lord has made; 
let us rejoice and be glad.
