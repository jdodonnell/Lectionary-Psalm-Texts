R. O God, let all the nations praise you!
May God have pity on us and bless us; 
may he let his face shine upon us. 
So may your way be known upon earth; 
among all nations, your salvation.
R. O God, let all the nations praise you!
May the nations be glad and exult 
because you rule the peoples in equity; 
the nations on the earth you guide.
R. O God, let all the nations praise you!
May the peoples praise you, O God; 
may all the peoples praise you! 
May God bless us, 
and may all the ends of the earth fear him!
R. O God, let all the nations praise you!
