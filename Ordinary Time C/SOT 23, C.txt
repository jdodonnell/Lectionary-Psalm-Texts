R. In every age, O Lord, you have been our refuge.
You turn man back to dust, 
saying, "Return, O children of men." 
For a thousand years in your sight 
are as yesterday, now that it is past, 
or as a watch of the night.
R. In every age, O Lord, you have been our refuge.
You make an end of them in their sleep; 
the next morning they are like the changing grass, 
Which at dawn springs up anew, 
but by evening wilts and fades.
R. In every age, O Lord, you have been our refuge.
Teach us to number our days aright, 
that we may gain wisdom of heart. 
Return, O LORD! How long? 
Have pity on your servants! 
R. In every age, O Lord, you have been our refuge.
Fill us at daybreak with your kindness, 
that we may shout for joy and gladness all our days. 
And may the gracious care of the LORD our God be ours; 
prosper the work of our hands for us! 
Prosper the work of our hands! 
R. In every age, O Lord, you have been our refuge.
