R. Lord, come to my aid!
I have waited, waited for the LORD, 
and he stooped toward me. 
R. Lord, come to my aid!
The LORD heard my cry. 
He drew me out of the pit of destruction, 
out of the mud of the swamp; 
he set my feet upon a crag; 
he made firm my steps.
R. Lord, come to my aid!
And he put a new song into my mouth, 
a hymn to our God. 
Many shall look on in awe 
and trust in the LORD.
R. Lord, come to my aid!
Though I am afflicted and poor, 
yet the LORD thinks of me. 
You are my help and my deliverer; 
O my God, hold not back!
R. Lord, come to my aid!
