R. Blessed are they who hope in the Lord.
Blessed the man who follows not 
    the counsel of the wicked, 
nor walks in the way of sinners, 
    nor sits in the company of the insolent, 
but delights in the law of the LORD 
    and meditates on his law day and night.
R. Blessed are they who hope in the Lord.
He is like a tree 
    planted near running water, 
that yields its fruit in due season, 
    and whose leaves never fade. 
    Whatever he does, prospers.
R. Blessed are they who hope in the Lord.
Not so the wicked, not so; 
    they are like chaff which the wind drives away. 
For the LORD watches over the way of the just, 
    but the way of the wicked vanishes.
R. Blessed are they who hope in the Lord.
