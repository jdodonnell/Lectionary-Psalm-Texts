R. Our help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
I lift up my eyes toward the mountains; 
whence shall help come to me? 
My help is from the LORD, 
who made heaven and earth.
R. Our help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
May he not suffer your foot to slip; 
may he slumber not who guards you: 
indeed he neither slumbers nor sleeps, 
the guardian of Israel.
R. Our help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
The LORD is your guardian; the LORD is your shade; 
he is beside you at your right hand. 
The sun shall not harm you by day, 
nor the moon by night. 
R. Our help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
The LORD will guard you from all evil; 
he will guard your life. 
The LORD will guard your coming and your going, 
both now and forever. 
R. Our help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
