R. Lord, on the day I called for help, you answered me.
I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with all my heart, 
for you have heard the words of my mouth; 
in the presence of the angels I will sing your praise; 
I will worship at your holy temple 
and give thanks to your name.
R. Lord, on the day I called for help, you answered me.
Because of your kindness and your truth; 
for you have made great above all things 
your name and your promise. 
When I called you answered me; 
you built up strength within me.
R. Lord, on the day I called for help, you answered me.
The LORD is exalted, yet the lowly he sees, 
and the proud he knows from afar. 
Though I walk amid distress, you preserve me; 
against the anger of my enemies you raise your hand.
R. Lord, on the day I called for help, you answered me.
Your right hand saves me. 
The LORD will complete what he has done for me; 
your kindness, O LORD, endures forever; 
forsake not the work of your hands.
R. Lord, on the day I called for help, you answered me.
