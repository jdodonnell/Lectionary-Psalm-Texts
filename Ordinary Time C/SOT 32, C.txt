R. Lord, when your glory appears, my joy will be full.
Hear, O LORD, a just suit; 
attend to my outcry; 
hearken to my prayer from lips without deceit.
R. Lord, when your glory appears, my joy will be full.
My steps have been steadfast in your paths, 
my feet have not faltered. 
I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God; 
incline your ear to me; hear my word.
R. Lord, when your glory appears, my joy will be full.
Keep me as the apple of your eye, 
hide me in the shadow of your wings. 
But I in justice shall behold your face; 
on waking I shall be content in your presence.
R. Lord, when your glory appears, my joy will be full.
