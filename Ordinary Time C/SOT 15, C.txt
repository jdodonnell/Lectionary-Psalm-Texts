I pray to you, O LORD, 
for the time of your favor, O God!

with your constant help. 
Answer me, O LORD, for bounteous is your kindness: 
in your great mercy turn toward me.

and I will glorify him with thanksgiving.

"See, you lowly ones, and be glad; 
you who seek God, may your hearts revive! 
For the LORD hears the poor, 
and his own who are in bonds he spurns not."

For God will save Zion 
and rebuild the cities of Judah. 
The descendants of his servants shall inherit it, 
and those who love his name shall inhabit it.
