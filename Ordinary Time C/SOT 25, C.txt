R. Praise the Lord who lifts up the poor.
Praise, you servants of the LORD, 
praise the name of the LORD. 
Blessed be the name of the LORD 
both now and forever.
R. Praise the Lord who lifts up the poor.
High above all nations is the LORD; 
above the heavens is his glory. 
Who is like the LORD, our God, who is enthroned on high 
and looks upon the heavens and the earth below?
R. Praise the Lord who lifts up the poor.
He raises up the lowly from the dust; 
from the dunghill he lifts up the poor 
to seat them with princes, 
with the princes of his own people.
R. Praise the Lord who lifts up the poor.
