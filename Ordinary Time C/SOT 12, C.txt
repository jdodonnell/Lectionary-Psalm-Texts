R. My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.
O God, you are my God whom I seek; 
for you my flesh pines and my soul thirsts 
like the earth, parched, lifeless and without water.
R. My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.
Thus have I gazed toward you in the sanctuary 
to see your power and your glory, 
for your kindness is a greater good than life; 
my lips shall glorify you.
R. My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.
Thus will I bless you while I live; 
lifting up my hands, I will call upon your name. 
As with the riches of a banquet shall my soul be satisfied, 
and with exultant lips my mouth shall praise you.
R. My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.
You are my help, 
and in the shadow of your wings I shout for joy. 
My soul clings fast to you; 
your right hand upholds me.
R. My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.
