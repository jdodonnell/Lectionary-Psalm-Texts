R. You are my inheritance, O Lord.
Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge; 
I say to the LORD, "My Lord are you. 
O LORD, my allotted portion and my cup, 
you it is who hold fast my lot."
R. You are my inheritance, O Lord.
I bless the LORD who counsels me; 
even in the night my heart exhorts me. 
I set the LORD ever before me; 
with him at my right hand I shall not be disturbed.
R. You are my inheritance, O Lord.
Therefore my heart is glad and my soul rejoices, 
my body, too, abides in confidence 
because you will not abandon my soul to the netherworld, 
nor will you suffer your faithful one to undergo corruption.
R. You are my inheritance, O Lord.
You will show me the path to life, 
fullness of joys in your presence, 
the delights at your right hand forever.
R. You are my inheritance, O Lord.
