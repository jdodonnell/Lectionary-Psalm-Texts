R. The Lord hears the cry of the poor.
I will bless the LORD at all times; 
his praise shall be ever in my mouth. 
Let my soul glory in the LORD; 
the lowly will hear me and be glad.
R. The Lord hears the cry of the poor.
The LORD confronts the evildoers, 
to destroy remembrance of them from the earth. 
When the just cry out, the Lord hears them, 
and from all their distress he rescues them.
R. The Lord hears the cry of the poor.
The LORD is close to the brokenhearted; 
and those who are crushed in spirit he saves. 
The LORD redeems the lives of his servants; 
no one incurs guilt who takes refuge in him.
