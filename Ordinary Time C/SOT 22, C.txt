R. God, in your goodness, you have made a home for the poor. 
The just rejoice and exult before God; 
they are glad and rejoice. 
Sing to God, chant praise to his name; 
whose name is the LORD. 
R. God, in your goodness, you have made a home for the poor. 
The father of orphans and the defender of widows 
is God in his holy dwelling. 
God gives a home to the forsaken; 
he leads forth prisoners to prosperity. 
R. God, in your goodness, you have made a home for the poor. 
A bountiful rain you showered down, O God, upon your inheritance; 
you restored the land when it languished; 
your flock settled in it; 
in your goodness, O God, you provided it for the needy.
R. God, in your goodness, you have made a home for the poor.
