Sing to the LORD a new song, 
for he has done wondrous deeds; 
his right hand has won victory for him, 
his holy arm.

The LORD has made his salvation known: 
in the sight of the nations he has revealed his justice. 
He has remembered his kindness and his faithfulness 
toward the house of Israel.
R. The Lord has revealed to the nations his saving power.
All the ends of the earth have seen
