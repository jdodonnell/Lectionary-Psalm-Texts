R. I will rise and go to my father.
Have mercy on me, O God, in your goodness; 
in the greatness of your compassion wipe out my offense. 
Thoroughly wash me from my guilt 
and of my sin cleanse me.
R. I will rise and go to my father.
A clean heart create for me, O God, 
and a steadfast spirit renew within me. 
Cast me not out from your presence, 
and your Holy Spirit take not from me.
R. I will rise and go to my father.
O Lord, open my lips, 
and my mouth shall proclaim your praise. 
My sacrifice, O God, is a contrite spirit; 
a heart contrite and humbled, O God, you will not spurn.
R. I will rise and go to my father.
