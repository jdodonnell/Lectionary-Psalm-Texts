R. The Lord comes to rule the earth with justice.
Sing praise to the LORD with the harp, 
with the harp and melodious song. 
With trumpets and the sound of the horn 
sing joyfully before the King, the LORD.
R. The Lord comes to rule the earth with justice.
Let the sea and what fills it resound, 
the world and those who dwell in it; 
let the rivers clap their hands, 
the mountains shout with them for joy.
R. The Lord comes to rule the earth with justice.
Before the LORD, for he comes, 
for he comes to rule the earth, 
He will rule the world with justice 
and the peoples with equity. 
R. The Lord comes to rule the earth with justice.
