R. Lord, make us turn to you; let us see your face 
and we shall be saved.
O shepherd of Israel, hearken, 
from your throne upon the cherubim, shine forth. 
Rouse your power, 
and come to save us. 
R. Lord, make us turn to you; let us see your face 
and we shall be saved.
Once again, O LORD of hosts, 
look down from heaven, and see; 
take care of this vine, 
and protect what your right hand has planted 
the son of man whom you yourself made strong.
R. Lord, make us turn to you; let us see your face 
and we shall be saved.
May your help be with the man of your right hand, 
with the son of man whom you yourself made strong. 
Then we will no more withdraw from you; 
give us new life, and we will call upon your name.
R. Lord, make us turn to you; let us see your face 
and we shall be saved.
