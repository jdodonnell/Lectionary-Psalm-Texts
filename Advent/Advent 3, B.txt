R. My soul rejoices in my God. 
My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord; 
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, 
for he has looked upon his lowly servant. 
From this day all generations will call me blessed.
R. My soul rejoices in my God. 
The Almighty has done great things for me, 
and holy is his Name. 
He has mercy on those who fear him 
in every generation. 
R. My soul rejoices in my God. 
He has filled the hungry with good things, 
and the rich he has sent away empty. 
He has come to the help of his servant Israel 
for he has remembered his promise of mercy.
R. My soul rejoices in my God.
