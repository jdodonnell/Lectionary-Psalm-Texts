R. Lord, let us see your kindness, 
and grant us your salvation.
I will hear what God proclaims; 
the LORD--for he proclaims peace. 
Near indeed is his salvation to those who fear him, 
glory dwelling in our land. 
R. Lord, let us see your kindness, 
and grant us your salvation.
Kindness and truth shall meet; 
justice and peace shall kiss. 
Truth shall spring out of the earth, 
and justice shall look down from heaven.
R. Lord, let us see your kindness, 
and grant us your salvation.
The LORD himself will give his benefits; 
our land shall yield its increase. 
Justice shall walk before him, 
and prepare the way of his steps. 
R. Lord, let us see your kindness, 
and grant us your salvation.
