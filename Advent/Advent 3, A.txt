R. Lord, come and save us. 
The LORD God keeps faith forever, 
secures justice for the oppressed, 
gives food to the hungry. 
The LORD sets captives free.
R. Lord, come and save us. 
The LORD gives sight to the blind; 
the LORD raises up those who were bowed down. 
The LORD loves the just; 
the LORD protects strangers.
R. Lord, come and save us. 
The fatherless and the widow he sustains, 
but the way of the wicked he thwarts. 
The LORD shall reign forever; 
your God, O Zion, through all generations. 
R. Lord, come and save us.
