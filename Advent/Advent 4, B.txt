R. Forever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
The promises of the LORD I will sing forever; 
through all generations my mouth shall proclaim your faithfulness. 
For you have said, "My kindness is established forever"; 
in heaven you have confirmed your faithfulness. 
R. Forever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"I have made a covenant with my chosen one, 
I have sworn to David my servant: 
Forever will I confirm your posterity 
and establish your throne for all generations."
R. Forever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"He shall say of me, 'You are my father, 
my God, the Rock, my savior.' 
Forever I will maintain my kindness toward him, 
and my covenant with him stands firm." 
R. Forever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
