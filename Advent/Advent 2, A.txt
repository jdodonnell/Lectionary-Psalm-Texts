R. Justice shall flourish in his time, 
and fullness of peace for ever. 
O God, with your judgment endow the king, 
and with your justice, the king's son; 
he shall govern your people with justice 
and your afflicted ones with judgment. 
R. Justice shall flourish in his time, 
and fullness of peace for ever. 
Justice shall flower in his days, 
and profound peace, till the moon be no more. 
May he rule from sea to sea, 
and from the River to the ends of the earth.
R. Justice shall flourish in his time, 
and fullness of peace for ever. 
For he shall rescue the poor when he cries out, 
and the afflicted when he has no one to help him. 
He shall have pity for the lowly and the poor; 
the lives of the poor he shall save.
R. Justice shall flourish in his time, 
and fullness of peace for ever. 
May his name be blessed forever; 
as long as the sun his name shall remain. 
In him shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed; 
all the nations shall proclaim his happiness. 
R. Justice shall flourish in his time, 
and fullness of peace for ever.
