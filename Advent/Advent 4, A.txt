R. Let the Lord enter; he is king of glory.
The LORD's are the earth and its fullness; 
the world and those who dwell in it. 
For he founded it upon the seas 
and established it upon the rivers.
R. Let the Lord enter; he is king of glory.
Who can ascend the mountain of the LORD? 
or who may stand in his holy place? 
One whose hands are sinless, whose heart is clean, 
who desires not what is vain.
R. Let the Lord enter; he is king of glory.
He shall receive a blessing from the LORD, 
a reward from God his savior. 
Such is the race that seeks for him, 
that seeks the face of the God of Jacob. 
R. Let the Lord enter; he is king of glory.
