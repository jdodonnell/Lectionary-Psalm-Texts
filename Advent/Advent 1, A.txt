I rejoiced because they said to me, 
"We will go up to the house of the LORD." 
And now we have set foot 
within your gates, O Jerusalem.
R. Let us go rejoicing to the house of the Lord.
Jerusalem, built as a city 
with compact unity. 
To it the tribes go up, 
the tribes of the LORD. 
R. Let us go rejoicing to the house of the Lord.
According to the decree for Israel, 
to give thanks to the name of the LORD. 
In it are set up judgment seats, 
seats for the house of David. 
R. Let us go rejoicing to the house of the Lord.
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem! 
May those who love you prosper! 
May peace be within your walls, 
prosperity in your buildings.

Because of my brothers and friends 
I will say, "Peace be within you!"

I will pray for your good.
R. Let us go rejoicing to the house of the Lord.
