R. The Lord has done great things for us; 
we are filled with joy.
When the LORD brought back the captives of Zion, 
we were like men dreaming. 
Then our mouth was filled with laughter, 
and our tongue with rejoicing.
R. The Lord has done great things for us; 
we are filled with joy.
Then they said among the nations, 
"The LORD has done great things for them." 
The LORD has done great things for us; 
we are glad indeed.
R. The Lord has done great things for us; 
we are filled with joy.
Restore our fortunes, O LORD, 
like the torrents in the southern desert. 
Those that sow in tears 
shall reap rejoicing.
R. The Lord has done great things for us; 
we are filled with joy.
Although they go forth weeping, 
carrying the seed to be sown, 
They shall come back rejoicing, 
carrying their sheaves.
R. The Lord has done great things for us; 
we are filled with joy.
