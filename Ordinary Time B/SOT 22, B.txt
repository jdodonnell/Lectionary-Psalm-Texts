R. He who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord.
One who walks blamelessly and does justice; 
who thinks the truth in his heart 
and slanders not with his tongue.
R. He who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord.
Who harms not his fellow man, 
nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor; 
by whom the reprobate is despised, 
while he honors those who fear the LORD.
R. He who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord.
Who lends not his money at usury 
and accepts no bribe against the innocent. 
One who does these things 
shall never be disturbed.
R. He who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord.
