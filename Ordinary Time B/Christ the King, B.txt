R. The LORD is king; he is robed in majesty.
The LORD is king, in splendor robed; 
robed is the LORD and girt about with strength.
R. The LORD is king; he is robed in majesty.
And he has made the world firm, 
not to be moved. 
Your throne stands firm from of old; 
from everlasting you are, O LORD.
R. The LORD is king; he is robed in majesty.
Your decrees are worthy of trust indeed; 
holiness befits your house, 
O LORD, for length of days.
R. The LORD is king; he is robed in majesty.
