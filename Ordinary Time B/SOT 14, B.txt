R. Our eyes are fixed on the Lord, pleading for his mercy.
To you I lift up my eyes 
who are enthroned in heaven- 
As the eyes of servants 
are on the hands of their masters. 
R. Our eyes are fixed on the Lord, pleading for his mercy.
As the eyes of a maid 
are on the hands of her mistress, 
So are our eyes on the LORD, our God, 
till he have pity on us. 
R. Our eyes are fixed on the Lord, pleading for his mercy.
Have pity on us, O LORD, have pity on us, 
for we are more than sated with contempt; 
our souls are more than sated 
with the mockery of the arrogant, 
with the contempt of the proud.
R. Our eyes are fixed on the Lord, pleading for his mercy.
