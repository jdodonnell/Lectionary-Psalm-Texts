R. I will praise you, Lord, for you have rescued me.
I will extol you, O LORD, for you drew me clear 
    and did not let my enemies rejoice over me. 
O LORD, you brought me up from the netherworld; 
    you preserved me from among those going down into the pit.
R. I will praise you, Lord, for you have rescued me.
Sing praise to the LORD, you his faithful ones, 
    and give thanks to his holy name. 
For his anger lasts but a moment; 
    a lifetime, his good will. 
At nightfall, weeping enters in, 
    but with the dawn, rejoicing.
R. I will praise you, Lord, for you have rescued me.
Hear, O LORD, and have pity on me; 
    O LORD, be my helper. 
You changed my mourning into dancing; 
    O LORD, my God, forever will I give you thanks.
R. I will praise you, Lord, for you have rescued me.
