R. With the Lord there is mercy and fullness of redemption. 
Out of the depths I cry to you, O LORD; 
LORD, hear my voice! 
Let your ears be attentive 
to my voice in supplication.
R. With the Lord there is mercy and fullness of redemption. 
If you, O LORD, mark iniquities, 
LORD, who can stand? 
But with you is forgiveness, 
that you may be revered. 
R. With the Lord there is mercy and fullness of redemption. 
I trust in the LORD; 
my soul trusts in his word. 
More than sentinels wait for the dawn, 
let Israel wait for the LORD. 
R. With the Lord there is mercy and fullness of redemption. 
For with the LORD is kindness 
and with him is plenteous redemption; 
And he will redeem Israel 
from all their iniquities. 
R. With the Lord there is mercy and fullness of redemption.
