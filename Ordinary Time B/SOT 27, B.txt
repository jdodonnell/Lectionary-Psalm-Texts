R. May the Lord bless us all the days of our lives.
Blessed are you who fear the LORD, 
who walk in his ways! 
For you shall eat the fruit of your handiwork; 
blessed shall you be, and favored.
R. May the Lord bless us all the days of our lives.
Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine 
in the recesses of your home; 
your children like olive plants 
around your table.
R. May the Lord bless us all the days of our lives.
Behold, thus is the man blessed 
who fears the LORD. 
The LORD bless you from Zion: 
may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem 
all the days of your life.
R. May the Lord bless us all the days of our lives.
May you see your children's children. 
Peace be upon Israel!
R. May the Lord bless us all the days of our lives.
