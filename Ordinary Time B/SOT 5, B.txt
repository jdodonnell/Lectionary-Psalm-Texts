R. Praise the Lord, who heals the brokenhearted. 
Praise the LORD, for he is good; 
sing praise to our God, for he is gracious; 
it is fitting to praise him. 
The LORD rebuilds Jerusalem; 
the dispersed of Israel he gathers.
R. Praise the Lord, who heals the brokenhearted. 
He heals the brokenhearted 
and binds up their wounds. 
He tells the number of the stars; 
he calls each by name. 
R. Praise the Lord, who heals the brokenhearted. 
Great is our Lord and mighty in power; 
to his wisdom there is no limit. 
The LORD sustains the lowly; 
the wicked he casts to the ground.
R. Praise the Lord, who heals the brokenhearted.
