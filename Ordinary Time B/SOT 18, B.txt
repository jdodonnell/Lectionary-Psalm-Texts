R. The Lord gave them bread from heaven. 
What we have heard and know, 
and what our fathers have declared to us, 
We will declare to the generation to come 
the glorious deeds of the Lord and his strength 
and the wonders that he wrought.
R. The Lord gave them bread from heaven. 
He commanded the skies above 
and opened the doors of heaven; 
he rained manna upon them for food 
and gave them heavenly bread. 
R. The Lord gave them bread from heaven. 
Man ate the bread of angels, 
food he sent them in abundance. 
And he brought them to his holy land, 
to the mountains his right hand had won.
R. The Lord gave them bread from heaven.
