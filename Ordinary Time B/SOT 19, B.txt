I will bless the LORD at all times; 
his praise shall be ever in my mouth. 
Let my soul glory in the LORD; 
the lowly will hear me and be glad.

Let us together extol his name.

And delivered me from all my fears.

Look to him that you may be radiant with joy. 
And your faces may not blush with shame. 
When the afflicted man called out, the LORD heard, 
And from all his distress he saved him.

The angel of the LORD encamps 
around those who fear him and delivers them.

blessed the man who takes refuge in him.
