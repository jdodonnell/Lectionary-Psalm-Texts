I will bless the LORD at all times; 
his praise shall be ever in my mouth. 
Let my soul glory in the LORD; 
the lowly will hear me and be glad.

The LORD has eyes for the just, 
and ears for their cry. 
The LORD confronts the evildoers, 
to destroy remembrance of them from the earth.
R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.
When the just cry out, the LORD hears them, 
and from all their distress he rescues them. 
The LORD is close to the brokenhearted; 
and those who are crushed in spirit he saves.
R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.
Many are the troubles of the just one, 
but out of them all the LORD delivers him; 
he watches over all his bones; 
not one of them shall be broken.
R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.
