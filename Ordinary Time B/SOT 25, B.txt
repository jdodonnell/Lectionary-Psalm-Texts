R. The Lord upholds my life.
O God, by your name save me, 
and by your might defend my cause. 
O God, hear my prayer; 
hearken to the words of my mouth.
R. The Lord upholds my life.
For the haughty men have risen up against me, 
the ruthless seek my life; 
they set not God before their eyes.
R. The Lord upholds my life.
Behold, God is my helper; 
the Lord sustains my life. 
Freely will I offer you sacrifice; 
I will praise your name, O LORD, for its goodness.
R. The Lord upholds my life.
