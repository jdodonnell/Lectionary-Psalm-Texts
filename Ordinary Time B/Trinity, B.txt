Upright is the word of the LORD, 
and all his works are trustworthy.

of the kindness of the Lord the earth is full.

By the word of the LORD the heavens were made; 
by the breath of his mouth all their host. 
For he spoke, and it was made; 
he commanded, and it stood forth.

See, the eyes of the LORD are upon those who fear him, 
upon those who hope for his kindness, 
To deliver them from death 
and preserve them in spite of famine.

Our soul waits for the LORD, 
who is our help and our shield. 
May your kindness, O LORD, be upon us 
who have put our hope in you.
