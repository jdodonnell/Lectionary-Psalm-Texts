R. Teach me your ways, O Lord.
Your ways, O LORD, make known to me; 
teach me your paths, 
Guide me in your truth and teach me, 
for you are God my savior. 
R. Teach me your ways, O Lord.
Remember that your compassion, O LORD, 
and your love are from of old. 
In your kindness remember me, 
because of your goodness, O LORD.
R. Teach me your ways, O Lord.
Good and upright is the LORD; 
thus he shows sinners the way. 
He guides the humble to justice 
and teaches the humble his way.
R. Teach me your ways, O Lord.
