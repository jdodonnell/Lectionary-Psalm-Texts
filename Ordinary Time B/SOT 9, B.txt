R. Sing with joy to God our help.
Take up a melody, and sound the timbrel, 
the pleasant harp and the lyre. 
Blow the trumpet at the new moon, 
at the full moon, on our solemn feast.
R. Sing with joy to God our help.
For it is a statute in Israel, 
an ordinance of the God of Jacob, 
Who made it a decree for Joseph 
when he came forth from the land of Egypt.
R. Sing with joy to God our help.
An unfamiliar speech I hear: 
"I relieved his shoulder of the burden; 
his hands were freed from the basket. 
In distress you called, and I rescued you." 
R. Sing with joy to God our help.
"There shall be no strange god among you 
nor shall you worship any alien god. 
I, the Lord, am your God 
who led you forth from the land of Egypt."
R. Sing with joy to God our help.
