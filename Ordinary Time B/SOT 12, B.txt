R. Give thanks to the Lord, his love is everlasting.
They who sailed the sea in ships, 
trading on the deep waters, 
These saw the works of the LORD 
and his wonders in the abyss.
R. Give thanks to the Lord, his love is everlasting.
His command raised up a storm wind 
which tossed its waves on high. 
They mounted up to heaven; they sank to the depths; 
their hearts melted away in their plight. 
R. Give thanks to the Lord, his love is everlasting.
They cried to the LORD in their distress; 
from their straits he rescued them, 
He hushed the storm to a gentle breeze, 
and the billows of the sea were stilled.
R. Give thanks to the Lord, his love is everlasting.
They rejoiced that they were calmed, 
and he brought them to their desired haven. 
Let them give thanks to the LORD for his kindness 
and his wondrous deeds to the children of men.
R. Give thanks to the Lord, his love is everlasting.
