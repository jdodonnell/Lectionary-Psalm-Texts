R. You are my inheritance, O Lord.
O LORD, my allotted portion and my cup, 
    you it is who hold fast my lot. 
I set the LORD ever before me; 
    with him at my right hand I shall not be disturbed.
R. You are my inheritance, O Lord.
Therefore my heart is glad and my soul rejoices, 
    my body, too, abides in confidence; 
because you will not abandon my soul to the 
        netherworld, 
    nor will you suffer your faithful one 
        to undergo corruption.
R. You are my inheritance, O Lord.
You will show me the path to life, 
    fullness of joys in your presence, 
    the delights at your right hand forever.
R. You are my inheritance, O Lord.
