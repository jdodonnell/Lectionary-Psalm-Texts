R. I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living.
I love the LORD because he has heard 
my voice in supplication, 
Because he has inclined his ear to me 
the day I called.
R. I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living.
The cords of death encompassed me; 
the snares of the netherworld seized upon me; 
I fell into distress and sorrow, 
And I called upon the name of the LORD, 
"O LORD, save my life!"
R. I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living.
Gracious is the LORD and just; 
yes, our God is merciful. 
The LORD keeps the little ones; 
I was brought low, and he saved me.
R. I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living.
For he has freed my soul from death, 
my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling. 
I shall walk before the Lord 
in the land of the living.
R. I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living.
