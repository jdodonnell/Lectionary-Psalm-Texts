R. Praise the Lord, my soul! 
The LORD keeps faith forever, 
secures justice for the oppressed, 
gives food to the hungry. 
The LORD sets captives free.
R. Praise the Lord, my soul! 
The LORD gives sight to the blind. 
The LORD raises up those who were bowed down; 
the LORD loves the just. 
The LORD protects strangers. 
R. Praise the Lord, my soul! 
The fatherless and the widow he sustains, 
but the way of the wicked he thwarts. 
The LORD shall reign forever; 
your God, O Zion, through all generations. Alleluia. 
R. Praise the Lord, my soul!
