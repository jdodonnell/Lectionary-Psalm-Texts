R. Lord, it is good to give thanks to you.
It is good to give thanks to the Lord, 
to sing praise to your name, Most High, 
To proclaim your kindness at dawn 
and your faithfulness throughout the night.
R. Lord, it is good to give thanks to you.
The just one shall flourish like the palm tree, 
like a cedar of Lebanon shall he grow. 
They that are planted in the house of the Lord 
shall flourish in the courts of our God. 
R. Lord, it is good to give thanks to you.
They shall bear fruit even in old age; 
vigorous and sturdy shall they be, 
Declaring how just is the Lord, 
my rock, in whom there is no wrong.
R. Lord, it is good to give thanks to you.
