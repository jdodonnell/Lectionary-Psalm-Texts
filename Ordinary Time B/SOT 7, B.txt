R. Lord, heal my soul, for I have sinned against you.
Blessed is the one who has regard for the lowly and the poor; 
in the day of misfortune the LORD will deliver him. 
The LORD will keep and preserve him; 
and make him blessed on earth, 
and not give him over to the will of his enemies.
R. Lord, heal my soul, for I have sinned against you.
The LORD will help him on his sickbed, 
he will take away all his ailment when he is ill. 
Once I said, "O LORD, have pity on me; 
heal me, though I have sinned against you."
R. Lord, heal my soul, for I have sinned against you.
But because of my integrity you sustain me 
and let me stand before you forever. 
Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, 
from all eternity. Amen. Amen.
R. Lord, heal my soul, for I have sinned against you.
