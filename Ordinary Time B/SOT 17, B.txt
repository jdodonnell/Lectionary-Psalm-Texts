Let all your works give you thanks, O LORD, 
and let your faithful ones bless you. 
Let them discourse of the glory of your kingdom 
and speak of your might.

The eyes of all look hopefully to you, 
and you give them their food in due season; 
you open your hand 
and satisfy the desire of every living thing.

The LORD is just in all his ways 
and holy in all his works. 
The LORD is near to all who call upon him, 
to all who call upon him in truth.
