R. Fill us with your love, O Lord, and we will sing for joy!
Teach us to number our days aright, 
that we may gain wisdom of heart. 
Return, O LORD! How long? 
Have pity on your servants!
R. Fill us with your love, O Lord, and we will sing for joy!
Fill us at daybreak with your kindness, 
that we may shout for joy and gladness all our days. 
Make us glad, for the days when you afflicted us, 
for the years when we saw evil.
R. Fill us with your love, O Lord, and we will sing for joy!
Let your work be seen by your servants 
and your glory by their children; 
and may the gracious care of the LORD our God be ours; 
prosper the work of our hands for us! 
Prosper the work of our hands!
R. Fill us with your love, O Lord, and we will sing for joy!
