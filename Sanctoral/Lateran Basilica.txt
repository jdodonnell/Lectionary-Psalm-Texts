R. The waters of the river gladden the city of God, the holy dwelling of the Most High!
God is our refuge and our strength, 
an ever-present help in distress. 
Therefore, we fear not, though the earth be shaken 
and mountains plunge into the depths of the sea. 
R. The waters of the river gladden the city of God, the holy dwelling of the Most High!
There is a stream whose runlets gladden the city of God, 
the holy dwelling of the Most High. 
God is in its midst; it shall not be disturbed; 
God will help it at the break of dawn. 
R. The waters of the river gladden the city of God, the holy dwelling of the Most High!
The LORD of hosts is with us; 
our stronghold is the God of Jacob. 
Come! behold the deeds of the LORD, 
the astounding things he has wrought on earth. 
R. The waters of the river gladden the city of God, the holy dwelling of the Most High!
