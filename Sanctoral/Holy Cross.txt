R. Do not forget the works of the Lord! 
Hearken, my people, to my teaching; 
incline your ears to the words of my mouth. 
I will open my mouth in a parable, 
I will utter mysteries from of old.
R. Do not forget the works of the Lord! 
While he slew them they sought him 
and inquired after God again, 
Remembering that God was their rock 
and the Most High God, their redeemer.
R. Do not forget the works of the Lord! 
But they flattered him with their mouths 
and lied to him with their tongues, 
Though their hearts were not steadfast toward him, 
nor were they faithful to his covenant. 
R. Do not forget the works of the Lord! 
But he, being merciful, forgave their sin 
and destroyed them not; 
Often he turned back his anger 
and let none of his wrath be roused. 
R. Do not forget the works of the Lord!
