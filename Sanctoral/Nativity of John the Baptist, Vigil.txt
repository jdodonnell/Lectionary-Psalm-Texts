R. Since my mother's womb, you have been my strength.
In you, O LORD, I take refuge; 
let me never be put to shame. 
In your justice rescue me, and deliver me; 
incline your ear to me, and save me.
R. Since my mother's womb, you have been my strength.
Be my rock of refuge, 
a stronghold to give me safety, 
for you are my rock and my fortress. 
O my God, rescue me from the hand of the wicked. 
R. Since my mother's womb, you have been my strength.
For you are my hope, O LORD; 
my trust, O LORD, from my youth. 
On you I depend from birth; 
from my mother's womb you are my strength. 
R. Since my mother's womb, you have been my strength.
My mouth shall declare your justice, 
day by day your salvation. 
O God, you have taught me from my youth, 
and till the present I proclaim your wondrous deeds. 
R. Since my mother's womb, you have been my strength.
