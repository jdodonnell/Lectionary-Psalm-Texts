Sing to the Lord a new song, 
for he has done wondrous deeds; 
His right hand has won victory for him, 
his holy arm.
R. Sing to the Lord a new song, 
for he has done marvelous deeds.
The Lord has made his salvation known: 
in the sight of the nations he has revealed his justice. 
He has remembered his kindness and his faithfulness 
toward the house of Israel.
R. Sing to the Lord a new song, 
for he has done marvelous deeds.
All the ends of the earth have seen 
the salvation by our God. 
Sing joyfully to the Lord, all you lands; 
break into song; sing praise.
R. Sing to the Lord a new song, 
for he has done marvelous deeds.
