R. Lord, go up to the place of your rest, 
you and the ark of your holiness.
Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah; 
we found it in the fields of Jaar. 
Let us enter his dwelling, 
let us worship at his footstool.
R. Lord, go up to the place of your rest, 
you and the ark of your holiness.
May your priests be clothed with justice; 
let your faithful ones shout merrily for joy. 
For the sake of David your servant, 
reject not the plea of your anointed.
R. Lord, go up to the place of your rest, 
you and the ark of your holiness.
For the LORD has chosen Zion; 
he prefers her for his dwelling. 
"Zion is my resting place forever; 
in her will I dwell, for I prefer her."
R. Lord, go up to the place of your rest, 
you and the ark of your holiness.
