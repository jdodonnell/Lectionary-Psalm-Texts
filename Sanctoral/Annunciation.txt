R. Here am I, Lord; I come to do your will.
Sacrifice or oblation you wished not, 
but ears open to obedience you gave me. 
Holocausts or sin-offerings you sought not; 
then said I, "Behold I come."
R. Here am I, Lord; I come to do your will.
"In the written scroll it is prescribed for me, 
To do your will, O my God, is my delight, 
and your law is within my heart!"
R. Here am I, Lord; I come to do your will.
I announced your justice in the vast assembly; 
I did not restrain my lips, as you, O LORD, know.
R. Here am I, Lord; I come to do your will.
Your justice I kept not hid within my heart; 
your faithfulness and your salvation I have spoken of; 
I have made no secret of your kindness and your truth 
in the vast assembly.
R. Here am I, Lord; I come to do your will.
