R. The Lord is king, the Most High over all the earth. 
The LORD is king; let the earth rejoice; 
let the many islands be glad. 
Clouds and darkness are round about him, 
justice and judgment are the foundation of his throne. 
R. The Lord is king, the Most High over all the earth. 
The mountains melt like wax before the LORD, 
before the LORD of all the earth. 
The heavens proclaim his justice, 
and all peoples see his glory. 
R. The Lord is king, the Most High over all the earth. 
Because you, O LORD, are the Most High over all the earth, 
exalted far above all gods. 
R. The Lord is king, the Most High over all the earth.
