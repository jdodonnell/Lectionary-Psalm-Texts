R. I praise you, for I am wonderfully made. 
O LORD, you have probed me, you know me: 
you know when I sit and when I stand; 
you understand my thoughts from afar. 
My journeys and my rest you scrutinize, 
with all my ways you are familiar. 
R. I praise you, for I am wonderfully made. 
Truly you have formed my inmost being; 
you knit me in my mother's womb. 
I give you thanks that I am fearfully, wonderfully made; 
wonderful are your works. 
R. I praise you, for I am wonderfully made. 
My soul also you knew full well; 
nor was my frame unknown to you 
When I was made in secret, 
when I was fashioned in the depths of the earth. 
R. I praise you, for I am wonderfully made.
