The promises of the LORD I will sing forever; 
through all generations my mouth shall proclaim your faithfulness, 
For you have said, "My kindness is established forever"; 
in heaven you have confirmed your faithfulness.
R. The son of David will live for ever.
"I have made a covenant with my chosen one, 
I have sworn to David my servant: 
Forever will I confirm your posterity 
and establish your throne for all generations."
R. The son of David will live for ever.
"He shall say of me, 'You are my father, 
my God, the Rock, my savior.' 
Forever I will maintain my kindness toward him, 
and my covenant with him stands firm."
R. The son of David will live for ever.
