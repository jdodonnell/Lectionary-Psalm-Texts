R. Their message goes out through all the earth.
The heavens declare the glory of God; 
and the firmament proclaims his handiwork. 
Day pours out the word to day; 
and night to night imparts knowledge.
R. Their message goes out through all the earth.
Not a word nor a discourse 
whose voice is not heard; 
through all the earth their voice resounds, 
and to the ends of the world, their message.
