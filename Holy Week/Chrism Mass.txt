R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"I have found David, my servant; 
with my holy oil I have anointed him. 
That my hand may always be with him; 
and that my arm may make him strong."
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"My faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him; 
and through my name shall his horn be exalted. 
He shall say of me, 'You are my father, 
my God, the Rock, my savior!'"
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
