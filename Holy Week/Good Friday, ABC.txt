R. Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.
In you, O LORD, I take refuge; 
let me never be put to shame. 
In your justice rescue me. 
Into your hands I commend my spirit; 
you will redeem me, O LORD, O faithful God. 
R. Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.
For all my foes I am an object of reproach, 
a laughingstock to my neighbors, and a dread to my friends; 
they who see me abroad flee from me. 
I am forgotten like the unremembered dead; 
I am like a dish that is broken. 
R. Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.
But my trust is in you, O LORD; 
I say, "You are my God. 
In your hands is my destiny; rescue me 
from the clutches of my enemies and my persecutors." 
R. Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.
Let your face shine upon your servant; 
save me in your kindness. 
Take courage and be stouthearted, 
all you who hope in the LORD. 
R. Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.
