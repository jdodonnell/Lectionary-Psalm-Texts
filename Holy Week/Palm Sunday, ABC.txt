R. My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?
All who see me scoff at me; 
    they mock me with parted lips, they wag their heads: 
"He relied on the LORD; let him deliver him, 
    let him rescue him, if he loves him."
R. My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?
Indeed, many dogs surround me, 
    a pack of evildoers closes in upon me; 
They have pierced my hands and my feet; 
    I can count all my bones.
R. My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?
They divide my garments among them, 
    and for my vesture they cast lots. 
But you, O LORD, be not far from me; 
    O my help, hasten to aid me.
R. My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?
I will proclaim your name to my brethren; 
    in the midst of the assembly I will praise you: 
"You who fear the LORD, praise him; 
    all you descendants of Jacob, give glory to him; 
    revere him, all you descendants of Israel!"
R. My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?
