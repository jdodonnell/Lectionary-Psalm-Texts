R. I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living.
I believed, even when I said, 
"I am greatly afflicted." 
Precious in the eyes of the LORD 
is the death of his faithful ones.
R. I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living.
O LORD, I am your servant; 
I am your servant, the son of your handmaid; 
you have loosed my bonds. 
To you will I offer sacrifice of thanksgiving, 
and I will call upon the name of the LORD.
R. I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living.
My vows to the LORD I will pay 
in the presence of all his people, 
In the courts of the house of the LORD, 
in your midst, O Jerusalem.
R. I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living.
