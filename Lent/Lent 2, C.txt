R. The Lord is my light and my salvation.
The LORD is my light and my salvation; 
    whom should I fear? 
The LORD is my life's refuge; 
    of whom should I be afraid?
R. The Lord is my light and my salvation.
Hear, O LORD, the sound of my call; 
    have pity on me, and answer me. 
Of you my heart speaks; you my glance seeks.
R. The Lord is my light and my salvation.
Your presence, O LORD, I seek. 
    Hide not your face from me; 
do not in anger repel your servant. 
    You are my helper: cast me not off.
R. The Lord is my light and my salvation.
I believe that I shall see the bounty of the LORD 
    in the land of the living. 
Wait for the LORD with courage; 
    be stouthearted, and wait for the LORD.
R. The Lord is my light and my salvation.
