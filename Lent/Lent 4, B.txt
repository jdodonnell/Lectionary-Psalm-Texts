R. Let my tongue be silenced, if I ever forget you! 
By the streams of Babylon 
we sat and wept 
when we remembered Zion. 
On the aspens of that land 
we hung up our harps.
R. Let my tongue be silenced, if I ever forget you! 
For there our captors asked of us 
the lyrics of our songs, 
And our despoilers urged us to be joyous: 
"Sing for us the songs of Zion!"
R. Let my tongue be silenced, if I ever forget you! 
How could we sing a song of the LORD 
in a foreign land? 
If I forget you, Jerusalem, 
may my right hand be forgotten!
R. Let my tongue be silenced, if I ever forget you! 
May my tongue cleave to my palate 
if I remember you not, 
If I place not Jerusalem 
ahead of my joy.
R. Let my tongue be silenced, if I ever forget you!
