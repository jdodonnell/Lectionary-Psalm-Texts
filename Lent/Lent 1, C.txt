R. Be with me, Lord, when I am in trouble.
You who dwell in the shelter of the Most High, 
    who abide in the shadow of the Almighty, 
say to the LORD, "My refuge and fortress, 
    my God in whom I trust."
R. Be with me, Lord, when I am in trouble.
No evil shall befall you, 
    nor shall affliction come near your tent, 
For to his angels he has given command about you, 
    that they guard you in all your ways.
R. Be with me, Lord, when I am in trouble.
Upon their hands they shall bear you up, 
    lest you dash your foot against a stone. 
You shall tread upon the asp and the viper; 
    you shall trample down the lion and the dragon.
R. Be with me, Lord, when I am in trouble.
Because he clings to me, I will deliver him; 
    I will set him on high 
        because he acknowledges my name. 
He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; 
    I will be with him in distress; 
I will deliver him and glorify him.
R. Be with me, Lord, when I am in trouble.
