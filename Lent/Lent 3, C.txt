Bless the LORD, O my soul; 
    and all my being, bless his holy name. 
Bless the LORD, O my soul, 
    and forget not all his benefits.
R. The Lord is kind and merciful.
He pardons all your iniquities, 
    heals all your ills, 
He redeems your life from destruction, 
    crowns you with kindness and compassion.
R. The Lord is kind and merciful.
The LORD secures justice 
    and the rights of all the oppressed. 
He has made known his ways to Moses, 
    and his deeds to the children of Israel.
R. The Lord is kind and merciful.
Merciful and gracious is the LORD, 
    slow to anger and abounding in kindness. 
For as the heavens are high above the earth, 
    so surpassing is his kindness 
        toward those who fear him.
R. The Lord is kind and merciful.
