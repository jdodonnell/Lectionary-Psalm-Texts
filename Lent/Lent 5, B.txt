R. Create a clean heart in me, O God.
Have mercy on me, O God, in your goodness; 
in the greatness of your compassion wipe out my offense. 
Thoroughly wash me from my guilt 
and of my sin cleanse me.
R. Create a clean heart in me, O God.
A clean heart create for me, O God, 
and a steadfast spirit renew within me. 
Cast me not out from your presence, 
and your Holy Spirit take not from me.
R. Create a clean heart in me, O God.
Give me back the joy of your salvation, 
and a willing spirit sustain in me. 
I will teach transgressors your ways, 
and sinners shall return to you.
R. Create a clean heart in me, O God.
