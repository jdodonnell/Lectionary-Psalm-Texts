R. Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.
Have mercy on me, O God, in your goodness; 
    in the greatness of your compassion 
        wipe out my offense. 
Thoroughly wash me from my guilt 
    and of my sin cleanse me.
R. Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.
For I acknowledge my offense, 
    and my sin is before me always: 
"Against you only have I sinned, 
    and done what is evil in your sight."
R. Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.
A clean heart create for me, O God, 
    and a steadfast spirit renew within me. 
Cast me not out from your presence, 
    and your Holy Spirit take not from me.
R. Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.
Give me back the joy of your salvation, 
    and a willing spirit sustain in me. 
O Lord, open my lips, 
    and my mouth shall proclaim your praise.
R. Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.
