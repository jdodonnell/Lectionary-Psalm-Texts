I will bless the LORD at all times; 
his praise shall be ever in my mouth. 
Let my soul glory in the LORD; 
the lowly will hear me and be glad.
R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.
Glorify the LORD with me, 
let us together extol his name. 
I sought the LORD, and he answered me 
and delivered me from all my fears.
R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.
Look to him that you may be radiant with joy, 
and your faces may not blush with shame. 
When the afflicted man called out, the LORD heard, 
and from all his distress he saved him.
R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.
