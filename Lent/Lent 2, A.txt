R. Lord, let your mercy be on us, 
as we place our trust in you.
Upright is the word of the LORD, 
and all his works are trustworthy. 
He loves justice and right; 
of the kindness of the LORD the earth is full.
R. Lord, let your mercy be on us, 
as we place our trust in you.
See, the eyes of the LORD are upon those who fear him, 
upon those who hope for his kindness, 
To deliver them from death 
and preserve them in spite of famine.
R. Lord, let your mercy be on us, 
as we place our trust in you.
Our soul waits for the LORD, 
who is our help and our shield. 
May your kindness, O LORD, be upon us 
who have put our hope in you.
R. Lord, let your mercy be on us, 
as we place our trust in you.
