God the LORD has spoken and summoned the earth, 
from the rising of the sun to its setting. 
"Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you, 
for your holocausts are before me always."
R. To the upright I will show the saving power of God. 
"If I were hungry, I would not tell you, 
for mine are the world and its fullness. 
Do I eat the flesh of strong bulls, 
or is the blood of goats my drink?"
R. To the upright I will show the saving power of God. 
"Offer to God praise as your sacrifice 
and fulfill your vows to the Most High; 
then call upon me in time of distress; 
I will rescue you, and you shall glorify me." 
R. To the upright I will show the saving power of God.
