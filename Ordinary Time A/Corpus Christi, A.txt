R. Praise the Lord, Jerusalem. 
Glorify the LORD, O Jerusalem; 
praise your God, O Zion. 
For he has strengthened the bars of your gates; 
he has blessed your children within you.
R. Praise the Lord, Jerusalem. 
He has granted peace in your borders; 
with the best of wheat he fills you. 
He sends forth his command to the earth; 
swiftly runs his word! 
R. Praise the Lord, Jerusalem. 
He has proclaimed his word to Jacob, 
his statutes and his ordinances to Israel. 
He has not done thus for any other nation; 
his ordinances he has not made known to them. Alleluia.
R. Praise the Lord, Jerusalem.
