R. The Lord is my light and my salvation.
The LORD is my light and my salvation; 
whom should I fear? 
The LORD is my life's refuge; 
of whom should I be afraid?
R. The Lord is my light and my salvation.
One thing I ask of the LORD; 
this I seek: 
to dwell in the house of the LORD 
all the days of my life, 
that I may gaze on the loveliness of the LORD 
and contemplate his temple. 
R. The Lord is my light and my salvation.
I believe that I shall see the bounty of the LORD 
in the land of the living. 
Wait for the LORD with courage; 
be stouthearted, and wait for the LORD. 
R. The Lord is my light and my salvation.
