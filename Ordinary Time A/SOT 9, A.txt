R. Lord, be my rock of safety.
In you, O Lord, I take refuge; 
let me never be put to shame. 
In your justice rescue me, 
incline your ear to me, 
make haste to deliver me! 
R. Lord, be my rock of safety.
Be my rock of refuge, 
a stronghold to give me safety. 
You are my rock and my fortress; 
for your name's sake you will lead and guide me. 
R. Lord, be my rock of safety.
Let your face shine upon your servant; 
save me in your kindness. 
Take courage and be stouthearted, 
all you who hope in the Lord. 
R. Lord, be my rock of safety.
