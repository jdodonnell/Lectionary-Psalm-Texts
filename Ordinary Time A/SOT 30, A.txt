R. I love you, Lord, my strength.
I love you, O LORD, my strength, 
O LORD, my rock, my fortress, my deliverer. 
R. I love you, Lord, my strength.
My God, my rock of refuge, 
my shield, the horn of my salvation, my stronghold! 
Praised be the LORD, I exclaim, 
and I am safe from my enemies.
R. I love you, Lord, my strength.
The LORD lives and blessed be my rock! 
Extolled be God my savior. 
You who gave great victories to your king 
and showed kindness to your anointed.
R. I love you, Lord, my strength.
