R. Lord, I love your commands.
I have said, O LORD, that my part 
is to keep your words. 
The law of your mouth is to me more precious 
than thousands of gold and silver pieces.
R. Lord, I love your commands.
Let your kindness comfort me 
according to your promise to your servants. 
Let your compassion come to me that I may live, 
for your law is my delight.
R. Lord, I love your commands.
For I love your command 
more than gold, however fine. 
For in all your precepts I go forward; 
every false way I hate.
R. Lord, I love your commands.
Wonderful are your decrees; 
therefore I observe them. 
The revelation of your words sheds light, 
giving understanding to the simple.
R. Lord, I love your commands.
