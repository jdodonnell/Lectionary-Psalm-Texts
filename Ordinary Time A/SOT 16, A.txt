R. Lord, you are good and forgiving.
You, O LORD, are good and forgiving, 
abounding in kindness to all who call upon you. 
Hearken, O LORD, to my prayer 
and attend to the sound of my pleading.
R. Lord, you are good and forgiving.
All the nations you have made shall come 
and worship you, O LORD, 
and glorify your name. 
For you are great, and you do wondrous deeds; 
you alone are God. 
R. Lord, you are good and forgiving.
You, O LORD, are a God merciful and gracious, 
slow to anger, abounding in kindness and fidelity. 
Turn toward me, and have pity on me; 
give your strength to your servant. 
R. Lord, you are good and forgiving.
