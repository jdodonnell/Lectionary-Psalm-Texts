R. The Lord is kind and merciful, slow to anger, 
and rich in compassion.
Bless the LORD, O my soul; 
and all my being, bless his holy name. 
Bless the LORD, O my soul, 
and forget not all his benefits.
R. The Lord is kind and merciful, slow to anger, 
and rich in compassion.
He pardons all your iniquities, 
heals all your ills. 
redeems your life from destruction, 
he crowns you with kindness and compassion.
R. The Lord is kind and merciful, slow to anger, 
and rich in compassion.
He will not always chide, 
nor does he keep his wrath forever. 
Not according to our sins does he deal with us, 
nor does he requite us according to our crimes.
R. The Lord is kind and merciful, slow to anger, 
and rich in compassion.
For as the heavens are high above the earth, 
so surpassing is his kindness toward those who fear him. 
As far as the east is from the west, 
so far has he put our transgressions from us.
R. The Lord is kind and merciful, slow to anger, 
and rich in compassion.
