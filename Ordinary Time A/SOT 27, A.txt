R. The vineyard of the Lord is the house of Israel.
A vine from Egypt you transplanted; 
you drove away the nations and planted it. 
It put forth its foliage to the Sea, 
its shoots as far as the River. 
R. The vineyard of the Lord is the house of Israel.
Why have you broken down its walls, 
so that every passer-by plucks its fruit, 
The boar from the forest lays it waste, 
and the beasts of the field feed upon it?
R. The vineyard of the Lord is the house of Israel.
Once again, O LORD of hosts, 
look down from heaven, and see; 
take care of this vine, 
and protect what your right hand has planted 
the son of man whom you yourself made strong.
R. The vineyard of the Lord is the house of Israel.
Then we will no more withdraw from you; 
give us new life, and we will call upon your name. 
O LORD, God of hosts, restore us; 
if your face shine upon us, then we shall be saved. 
R. The vineyard of the Lord is the house of Israel.
