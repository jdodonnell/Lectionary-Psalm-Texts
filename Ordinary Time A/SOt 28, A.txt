R. I shall live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. 
In verdant pastures he gives me repose; 
beside restful waters he leads me; 
he refreshes my soul. 
R. I shall live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.
He guides me in right paths 
for his name's sake. 
Even though I walk in the dark valley 
I fear no evil; for you are at my side 
with your rod and your staff 
that give me courage. 
R. I shall live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.
You spread the table before me 
in the sight of my foes; 
you anoint my head with oil; 
my cup overflows. 
R. I shall live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.
Only goodness and kindness follow me 
all the days of my life; 
and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD 
for years to come.
R. I shall live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.
