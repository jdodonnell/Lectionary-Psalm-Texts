R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
The promises of the LORD I will sing forever, 
through all generations my mouth shall proclaim your faithfulness. 
For you have said, "My kindness is established forever;" 
in heaven you have confirmed your faithfulness.
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
Blessed the people who know the joyful shout; 
in the light of your countenance, O LORD, they walk. 
At your name they rejoice all the day, 
and through your justice they are exalted. 
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
You are the splendor of their strength, 
and by your favor our horn is exalted. 
For to the LORD belongs our shield, 
and the Holy One of Israel, our king.
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
