R. The just man is a light in darkness to the upright.
Light shines through the darkness for the upright; 
he is gracious and merciful and just. 
Well for the man who is gracious and lends, 
who conducts his affairs with justice. 
R. The just man is a light in darkness to the upright.
He shall never be moved; 
the just one shall be in everlasting remembrance. 
An evil report he shall not fear; 
his heart is firm, trusting in the LORD. 
R. The just man is a light in darkness to the upright.
His heart is steadfast; he shall not fear. 
Lavishly he gives to the poor; 
his justice shall endure forever; 
his horn shall be exalted in glory.
R. The just man is a light in darkness to the upright.
