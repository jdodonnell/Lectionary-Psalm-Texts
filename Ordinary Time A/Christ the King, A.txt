R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. 
In verdant pastures he gives me repose.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
Beside restful waters he leads me; 
he refreshes my soul. 
He guides me in right paths 
for his name's sake.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
You spread the table before me 
in the sight of my foes; 
you anoint my head with oil; 
my cup overflows.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
Only goodness and kindness follow me 
all the days of my life; 
and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD 
for years to come. 
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
