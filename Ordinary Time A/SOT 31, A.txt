R. In you, Lord, I have found my peace. 
O LORD, my heart is not proud, 
nor are my eyes haughty; 
I busy not myself with great things, 
nor with things too sublime for me.
R. In you, Lord, I have found my peace. 
Nay rather, I have stilled and quieted 
my soul like a weaned child. 
Like a weaned child on its mother's lap, 
so is my soul within me.
R. In you, Lord, I have found my peace. 
O Israel, hope in the LORD, 
both now and forever. 
R. In you, Lord, I have found my peace.
