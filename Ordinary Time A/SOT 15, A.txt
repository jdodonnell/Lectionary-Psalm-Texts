R. The seed that falls on good ground will yield 
a fruitful harvest.
You have visited the land and watered it; 
greatly have you enriched it. 
God's watercourses are filled; 
you have prepared the grain.
R. The seed that falls on good ground will yield 
a fruitful harvest.
Thus have you prepared the land: drenching its furrows, 
breaking up its clods, 
softening it with showers, 
blessing its yield. 
R. The seed that falls on good ground will yield 
a fruitful harvest.
You have crowned the year with your bounty, 
and your paths overflow with a rich harvest; 
the untilled meadows overflow with it, 
and rejoicing clothes the hills. 
R. The seed that falls on good ground will yield 
a fruitful harvest.
The fields are garmented with flocks 
and the valleys blanketed with grain. 
They shout and sing for joy. 
R. The seed that falls on good ground will yield 
a fruitful harvest.
