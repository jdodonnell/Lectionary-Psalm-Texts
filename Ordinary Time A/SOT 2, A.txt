R. Here am I, Lord; I come to do your will.
I have waited, waited for the LORD, 
and he stooped toward me and heard my cry. 
And he put a new song into my mouth, 
a hymn to our God. 
R. Here am I, Lord; I come to do your will.
Sacrifice or offering you wished not, 
but ears open to obedience you gave me. 
Holocausts or sin-offerings you sought not; 
then said I, "Behold I come."
R. Here am I, Lord; I come to do your will.
"In the written scroll it is prescribed for me, 
to do your will, O my God, is my delight, 
and your law is within my heart!" 
R. Here am I, Lord; I come to do your will.
I announced your justice in the vast assembly; 
I did not restrain my lips, as you, O LORD, know. 
R. Here am I, Lord; I come to do your will.
