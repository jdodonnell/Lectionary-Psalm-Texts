R. Blessed are the poor in spirit; 
the kingdom of heaven is theirs!
The LORD keeps faith forever, 
secures justice for the oppressed, 
gives food to the hungry. 
The LORD sets captives free.
R. Blessed are the poor in spirit; 
the kingdom of heaven is theirs!
The LORD gives sight to the blind; 
the LORD raises up those who were bowed down. 
The LORD loves the just; 
the LORD protects strangers.
R. Blessed are the poor in spirit; 
the kingdom of heaven is theirs!
The fatherless and the widow the LORD sustains, 
but the way of the wicked he thwarts. 
The LORD shall reign forever; 
your God, O Zion, through all generations. Alleluia. 
R. Blessed are the poor in spirit; 
the kingdom of heaven is theirs!
