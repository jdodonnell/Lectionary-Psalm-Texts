R. Lord, your love is eternal; do not forsake 
the work of your hands. 
I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with all my heart, 
for you have heard the words of my mouth; 
in the presence of the angels I will sing your praise; 
I will worship at your holy temple. 
R. Lord, your love is eternal; do not forsake 
the work of your hands. 
I will give thanks to your name, 
because of your kindness and your truth: 
when I called, you answered me; 
you built up strength within me. 
R. Lord, your love is eternal; do not forsake 
the work of your hands. 
The LORD is exalted, yet the lowly he sees, 
and the proud he knows from afar. 
Your kindness, O LORD, endures forever; 
forsake not the work of your hands. 
R. Lord, your love is eternal; do not forsake 
the work of your hands.
